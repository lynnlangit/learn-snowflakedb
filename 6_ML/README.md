# AI/Machine Learning + GenAI

SnowflakeDB has a large number of integrated tools/libraries for AI/ML --> [link](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/workloads/ai-ml/) 

## Snowpark Python Worksheets

From SnowflakeDB [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight-quick-tour): *"In Snowsight, you can perform data analysis and engineering tasks, monitor query and data loading and transformation activity, explore your Snowflake database objects, and administer your Snowflake database, including managing the cost and adding users and roles. See example screenshot after features list. Snowsight lets you:*

- Build, test, and deploy Snowpark Python Worksheets.
- Write queries and code, and take advantage of autocomplete for database objects and SQL functions in worksheets.
- Organize worksheets into folders.
- Share worksheets and dashboards with other users.
- Visualize worksheet results in charts and dashboards.
- Create and manage database objects such as databases, tables, stages, file formats, and more.
- Manage costs and set budgets.
- Review query history and data loading history.
- See task graphs and run history.
- Debug and rerun failed task graphs.
- Monitor dynamic table graphs and refreshes.
- Manage and create Snowflake users and roles and visualize a hierarchy of roles and their grants.
- Perform data governance tasks like masking data, adding policies, and reviewing the governance of your data.

## GenAI for SnowflakeDB

CortexAI (from SnowflakeDB site) allows you to... *"quickly analyze data and build generative AI applications using fully managed LLMs, vector search and fully managed text-to-SQL services. Enable multiple users to use AI models with no-code, SQL and Python interfaces."*  Shown below is the tech stack
